     - `references.html`: Lists the references and resources used.
     - `styles.css`: Stylesheet for the project.
     - `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling map interactions and fetching data.
   - `serve.py`: The main Flask application file.

     - Sets up the Flask server and handles routes.
     - Connects to the PostgreSQL database.
     - Defines API endpoints for fetching lake data.
   - `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies.
   - `README.md`: The main project readme file.
   - `SETUP.md`: Setup guide for the project.
   - `CODE_DESCRIPTION.md`: This document.

   ## Dependencies

   - **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
   - **psycopg2-binary**: PostgreSQL database adapter for Python.
   - **Leaflet.js**: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
   - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

   ## Functionality

   ### `index.html`

   - Provides the main homepage with options to choose between the map and list view.
   - Links to the references and about pages.

   ### `lake_list.html`

   - Displays a list of lakes by state.
   - Allows users to select a date and fetch historical data for a selected lake.

   ### `map.html`

   - Displays an interactive map with clickable markers for each lake.
   - Allows users to select a lake and a date to fetch historical data.

   ### `lake_details.html`

   - Displays detailed water quality data for a selected lake.
   - Fetches data based on the lake name and date provided in the URL parameters.

   ### `about.html`

   - Provides information about the website and its features.

   ### `references.html`

   - Lists the references and resources used in the project.

   ### `styles.css`

   - Stylesheet for the project, including different shades of blue for each page and elements.

   ### `script.js`

   - Handles map interactions and fetching data from the server.
   - Updates the dropdown based on the visible lakes.
   - Displays detailed data in popups.

   ### `serve.py`

   - Sets up the Flask server and handles routes.
   - Connects to the PostgreSQL database.
   - Defines API endpoints for fetching lake data by name and date.
   - Serves static files and templates.

   ## Extending the Project

   To extend the project for a larger scope, consider the following:

   1. **Add More Lakes and Data**:

      - Populate the database with more lake data, including additional parameters if needed.
   2. **Enhance Visualizations**:

      - Use more advanced visualization libraries like D3.js or Plotly for better data representation.
   3. **Implement More Features**:

      - Add user authentication and personalized dashboards.
      - Include more water quality parameters and detailed analysis.
   4. **Optimize Performance**:

      - Optimize database queries and server responses for better performance with larger datasets.
   5. **Deploy to Production**:

      - Use a production-ready WSGI server like Gunicorn.
      - Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
